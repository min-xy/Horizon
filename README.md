# Horizon

This repository contains a continuation of the heavily customized F-Chat Rising, a version of the mainline F-Chat 3.0 client.

## Features

In a non-exhaustive list, Horizon has these features!

- **Profile matching** automatically compares your profile with others to determine with whom you are compatible.
- **Automatic ad posting** repeatedly posts and rotates ads on selected channels.
- **Link previews** popup shows a preview of an image / video when you hover your mouse over a link.
- **Caching** speeds up profile loads and other actions.
- **Smart filters** let you choose what kind of ads and posts you see in the chat.

## Goals

Horizon aims to be an opinionated fork of F-Chat Rising. Instead of aiming solely to be a more customized fork of the original client, we aim to:

- **Maintain Cross-Platform Compatibility**  
  Ensure full functionality across Linux, Windows, and macOS without bias toward any specific platform.

- **Show Function Over Form**  
  Prioritize features, usability, and reliability over appearance. Adopt modern feature sets and evolving standards.

- **Be Community-Driven**  
  Foster an open, collaborative development environment guided by the community. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.

- **Have Safe and High-Quality Code**  
  Enforce strict code quality standards, specifically in readability, maintainability, and safety.

- **Be Simple by Default, Powerful When Needed**  
  All additional features should be optional, and when possible, disabled by default.

- **Have a Fork-Friendly Foundation**  
  Establish a solid base that can be easily adapted for future forks with different objectives.

- **Retain Core Features**  
  Maintain _all core_ functionality from the original _Rising_ project.

It should be known that this project aligns closely with the ideaology of [KDE](https://manifesto.kde.org)

### Additional installation instructions

#### Debian/Ubuntu (deb)

1. Download the `.deb` file for your architecture from the [latest release](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/releases/latest).
   Look for `F-Chat.Horizon-*-linux-amd64.deb` (x64) or `F-Chat.Horizon-*-linux-arm64.deb` (arm64).
2. Install (replace "`<arch>`" with the architecture from the downloaded filename):
   ```bash
   sudo dpkg -i F-Chat.Horizon-linux-<arch>.deb
   ```

#### Fedora/RPM-based (rpm)

1. Download the `.rpm` file for your architecture from the [latest release](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/releases/latest).
   Look for `F-Chat.Horizon-*-linux-x86_64.rpm` (x64) or `F-Chat.Horizon-*-linux-aarch64.rpm` (arm64).
2. Install using your package manager (replace "`<arch>`" with the architecture from the downloaded filename):
   - **Fedora/RHEL/CentOS:**
     ```bash
     sudo dnf install F-Chat.Horizon-linux-<arch>.rpm
     ```
   - **openSUSE:**
     ```bash
     sudo zypper install F-Chat.Horizon-linux-<arch>.rpm
     ```
   - **Generic RPM:**
     ```bash
     sudo rpm -i F-Chat.Horizon-linux-<arch>.rpm
     ```

##### NixOS

Horizon is available as a Nix Flake input based on the GitHub repo. See [this](https://nix.dev/manual/nix/2.28/command-ref/new-cli/nix3-flake.html#flake-inputs) page for more information.

```nix
    horizon = {
      url = "github:Fchat-Horizon/Horizon?ref=main";
      inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs-unstable";
    };
```

You can then reference this input as a System Package or user-specific package:

```nix
      environment.systemPackages = [
        inputs.horizon.packages.\${pkgs.system}.horizon-electron
      ];
```

Our repository's default branch is `development`, which is not strictly guaranteed to build (nor is it expected to!)-- so note the `?ref=main` after the Git URL, which is what we use for _stable releases_. If you want to follow the beta update track, or use nightly builds, replace `main` with `beta` or `development` respectively in the `?ref=<source>` URL parameter for the Flake input.

#### AppImage

1. Download the AppImage for your architecture from the [latest release](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/releases/latest).
   Look for `F-Chat.Horizon-*-linux-x86_64.AppImage` (x64) or `F-Chat.Horizon-*-linux-arm64.AppImage` (arm64).
2. Make it executable, then run (replace "`<arch>`" with the architecture from the downloaded filename):
   ```bash
   chmod +x F-Chat.Horizon-linux-<arch>.AppImage
   ./F-Chat.Horizon-linux-<arch>.AppImage
   ```

#### Tarball (tar.gz)

1. Download the `.tar.gz` for your architecture from the [latest release](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/releases/latest).
   Look for `F-Chat.Horizon-*-linux-x64.tar.gz` (x64) or `F-Chat.Horizon-*-linux-arm64.tar.gz` (arm64).
2. Extract and run (replace "`<arch>`" with the architecture from the downloaded filename):
   ```bash
   tar -xzf F-Chat.Horizon-linux-<arch>.tar.gz
   cd F-Chat.Horizon-linux-<arch>
   ./F-Chat.Horizon
   ```

#### Arch-based (AUR)

> [!NOTE]
> The AUR package currently doesn't support ARM.

> [!NOTE]
> The AUR package is not directly maintained by the Horizon team. If you have any issues with it, please check if they can be reproduced in an official build first before reporting them.

- With an AUR helper:
  ```bash
  yay|paru|etc -S fchat-horizon-bin
  ```
- Manually:
  ```bash
  git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/fchat-horizon-bin.git
  cd fchat-horizon-bin
  makepkg -si
  ```

## From Source

If you want to compile and install Horizon from the source code yourself, please see the build and packaging instructions in the [contributing document](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

# Usage

## Getting started

When you first load Horizon, you'll notice its interface is closely similar to the original client. However, note the added menus:

1. **Ad Editor**: Located underneath your profile, entering the Ad editor will open an additional menu. Here you can edit the ads you want to post!
   - Assign a 'tag' to your ads. You can use the 'post ads' function to post ads of specific tag types into specified channels.
2. **Post Ads**: Located under the Ad Editor, clicking this button will open the ad posting dialog. You can select the tags and channels for your ads.
3. **Settings**: Horizon adds additional settings under the settings button.
   - _The Horizon tab_: Contains general settings for Horizon
   - _The Smart Filters tab_: Here you can configure the smart filters. **Be aware that this is a work in progress!**
